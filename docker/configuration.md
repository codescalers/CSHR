# Runing the project using Docker and Docker Compose

To run the full project with all instances, follow these steps:

1. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file beside the [config](./config/) directory and set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the previous section for sample environment variable configurations.

2. Execute Docker Compose

Run the following command to start the Docker containers:

```sh
# --> To run all services

└─(✹)──> docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file=./config/.env up --build -d 

# --> To stop all services
└─(✹)──> docker compose -f ./docker/docker-compose.yml --env-file=./config/.env down 

```

Also, you can excute the command using Make:

- make docker-up **To run all services**
- make docker-down **To stop all services**

After executing the command, you should see a confirmation similar to the following:

3. Verify Successful Deployment

This indicates that the Docker containers are being created and the services are starting up.
